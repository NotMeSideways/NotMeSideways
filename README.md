- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NotMeSideways

Messing with building a light PHP framework with minimal dependancies and without a lot of extra typing filling up my screen. Autoloading 140 files you don't know to display 'Hello World' on a web page is insanity.

Mainly done to support another project I'm working on, so not going to be very generic to start with.

I will be going against PSRs at times. Like code layout or sticking every class in a separate file... this isn't java. 

And watch out for lots of short, esoteric helper functions as I find things like SuperDocumentCacheImplFactorWorkerResponderReflectorHelper::convert() annoying to write and view.
